# odin-landing-page
This project is being created as a part of the Foundations Course from The Odin Project's curriculum.

After having learned the basics of CSS, I am being tasked with creating a webpage from scratch given a design.

## Initial After-thoughts
I am pretty satisfied with the way it turned out visually; I feel like it is a pretty faithful recreation of the design provided by The Odin Project. The thing that sticks out to me about the process is how poorly I feel like I implemented the CSS. In retrospect, I recognize that I used classes suboptimally, to the point where there are many redundencies - almost like I used IDs instead.

When I am more experienced, I plan on revisiting this project, and rewriting the style sheet to better optimize the power of classes and shared rule sets. At this point in time, however, I am satisfied with the result and look forward to progressing through the Foundations course!
